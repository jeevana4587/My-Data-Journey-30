# 📅 Day 13 – Continued Learning: Alex The Analyst Bootcamp

🎓 Today I focused on strengthening my fundamentals in data analysis by continuing with the **Alex The Analyst YouTube Bootcamp**.

---

## 📺 Videos Watched:
1. **[Intro to SQL for Data Analysts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6kFIK9G9vI)**  
   → Covered basic SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and filtering logic in SQL

2. **[Data Analyst Resume Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IuV9k0gFqY)**  
   → Learned how to present data projects, highlight tools, and align resume with job roles

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Even basic SQL can be powerful when writing clean queries
- Business thinking is more important than complex visuals
- A portfolio project should clearly show insights, not just code
- Important to quantify impact (e.g., “automated X hours of work/week”)

---

## 🧭 Plan:
- Resume hands-on Power BI improvements or start new dataset work in Day 14
- Continue watching 1–2 bootcamp videos daily and apply what I learn

⏳ Note: Today was focused on **learning, not coding**, but it’s part of my 30-day progress.
