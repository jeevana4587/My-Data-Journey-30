# 📊 Day 9 – Basic EDA and Visual Insights (Combined with Day 8)

Today, I performed a full exploratory data analysis on the cleaned Data Science Salaries dataset.

## 📈 Visualizations Created:
1. **Salary Distribution** – Histogram with KDE plot  
2. **Experience Level Distribution** – Countplot  
3. **Salary by Experience Level** – Boxplot  
4. **Salary by Employment Type** – Boxplot  
5. **Remote Ratio vs Salary** – Scatterplot  
6. **Top 10 Highest Paying Job Titles** – Horizontal bar chart  
7. **Salary Boxplot** – Outlier view of salary  
8. **Scatterplot of Salary vs Experience Level**

## 📌 Insights Observed:
- **Senior-level roles dominate** the job market.
- **Full-time** is the most common employment type by far.
- **Salary ranges increase clearly with experience**.
- **Remote jobs** don't necessarily guarantee higher pay.
- **Data Science Tech Lead** is the highest-paying role in this dataset.
- **Most companies are medium-sized**, with far fewer small or large organizations.
