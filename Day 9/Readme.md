# ðŸ“… Day 8 â€“ No Task Logged

I wasn't able to complete any task today due to personal or scheduling constraints.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Plan:
- This day will be merged with the next active workday (Day 9)
- The original planned task will be completed as part of Day 9â€™s progress

---

ðŸ§  Reminder: This 30-day journey is about long-term consistency, not daily perfection. Iâ€™m resuming with renewed focus on Day 9.
