📊 Day 9 – Basic EDA and Visual Insights (Combined with Day 8)
Today, I performed a full exploratory data analysis on the cleaned Data Science Salaries dataset.

📈 Visualizations Created:
Salary Distribution – Histogram with KDE plot
Experience Level Distribution – Countplot
Salary by Experience Level – Boxplot
Salary by Employment Type – Boxplot
Remote Ratio vs Salary – Scatterplot
Top 10 Highest Paying Job Titles – Horizontal bar chart
Salary Boxplot – Outlier view of salary
Scatterplot of Salary vs Experience Level


📌 Insights Observed:
Senior-level roles dominate the job market.
Full-time is the most common employment type by far.
Salary ranges increase clearly with experience.
Remote jobs don't necessarily guarantee higher pay.
Data Science Tech Lead is the highest-paying role in this dataset.
Most companies are medium-sized, with far fewer small or large organizations.
