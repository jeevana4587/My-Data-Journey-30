# ❓ Problem Statement – Global Job Market Trends for Data Professionals

The demand for data professionals—such as data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers—is increasing rapidly across the globe. However, this demand is uneven across countries, industries, and job roles.

Many aspiring professionals (especially students and early-career learners) struggle to understand:
- Which countries are hiring the most?
- What skills are in demand?
- How much are companies paying?
- What are the top technologies and roles in this field?

## 🧭 Goal
This project aims to:
- Analyze real-world job and salary data from global sources.
- Identify top skills, locations, and roles.
- Provide clear visual insights using Power BI and Python.
- Help learners like me—and even recruiters—understand current hiring trends.

## 📈 Outcome
A complete analysis and interactive dashboard that shows:
- Job demand by country
- In-demand tools and skills
- Salary comparisons by role/region
- Time-based demand shifts (if available in data)

This will also serve as a public portfolio project to demonstrate my skills in:
- Data Analytics (Power BI, SQL, Excel)
- Data Science (Python, Pandas, Visualization)
- Insight generation & storytelling
