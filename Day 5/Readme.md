# 📅 Day 5 – Data Cleaning with Python (Missed)

**Status:** I wasn’t able to complete today's task due to time constraints.

🔁 **Plan:** I will combine this task with Day 6 and continue as planned.

📌 **Originally Planned Tasks for Day 5:**
- Identify and handle missing values in the dataset
- Rename inconsistent columns
- Format salary, title, and company fields
- Prepare cleaned data for analysis in Day 6

⏳ **Last updated:** 5th July 2025

**Note to self:** This journey is about consistency, not perfection. One missed day doesn't break the goal. Staying on track ✅
